INSERT INTO metric.analyses (analysis_id, report_id, sort_order, analysis_name, description) VALUES (1, 1, 1, 'Metrics', 'Common metrics used to assess freshwater biological integrity, as well as basic field and lab processing information. Note that values for richness based metrics are standardized to operational taxonomic units (OTUs; sensu Cuffney et al. 2007) and a fixed count (i.e., rarefaction) of 300, but density metrics are based on the raw taxa list. Standardized metrics are indicated with an asterisk. NAMC OTU standardization uses the method of removing individuals identified to the coarser taxonomic resolution or merging finer level identifications to coarser levels. We are able to standardize your data to custom OTUs and/or fixed counts if provided, although additional charges may apply.  A more detailed explanation of each metric, as well as references, can be obtained by contacting NAMC and will soon be available on our website.');
